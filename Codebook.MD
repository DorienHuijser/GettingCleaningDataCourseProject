## General information
The information included in this codebook was derived by the information provided on the website of the original dataset, see [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

**Participants**: n = 30, 19-48 years old

**Procedure**: each participant wore a smartphone on the waist that measured acceleration and velocity at 50Hz using an *accelerometer* and *gyroscope* during 6 activities:

- Walking
- Walking upstairs
- Walking downstairs
- Sitting
- Standing
- Laying down

**Preprocessing**: the signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope were noise-filtered and sampled, see Anguita et al. (2012) for more details.
